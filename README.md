# EncryptionAlgorithm

## 🔐 Description
EncryptionAlgorithm is a custom encryption algorithm written in **C++**, created for educational purposes and experimentation with basic encryption techniques.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how an encryption–decryption mechanism can be implemented from scratch.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is **not intended for production or real-world security use**.  
> Do **not** use it to protect real passwords or sensitive data.

## 🚀 Features
- Custom text/password encryption
- Decryption using the same algorithm
- Simple and readable C++ implementation
- Example source files in different languages (English / Greek)

## 🛠 Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- C++17 or newer

---

## ⚙️ Compilation

Using **g++**:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 MyOwnEncryptionMethod.cpp -o encryptor
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./encryptor
```

Follow the instructions in the console to encrypt or decrypt text.

---

## 🧪 Example (Pseudo Code)

```cpp
string encrypted = encrypt("mypassword");
string decrypted = decrypt(encrypted);
```

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created:
- For learning purposes
- To practice C++ programming
- To understand basic encryption logic
